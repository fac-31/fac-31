2. You must never commit to main
3. You must get your Pull Request reviewed by another team member

## Helpful Links

- A [guide to GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), the default git workflow at FAC
- A [FAC workshop](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/git-workflow/) to teach `git` fundamentals. The info is still good, but you'll need to adapt the steps to our purposes
