# Jaz
## they/them

### How I get my best work done:
I get my best work done when there is space for me to explore and experiment with an idea. I always appreciate collaboration. 

### The role I usually take in a team:
I'm still figuring this out about myself, and it depends on the team dynamics and the task at hand.

### My communication style:
Some might say over-communicative, but I would say just the right amount :) I like things to be spoken and clear so we all know where we're at. 

### What I value:
Having an enthusiastic and creative approach to work - because it's got to be fun right? Having different brains and ways of thinking on a project. A supportive and kind attitude. 

### What people misunderstand about me:
I'm often very anxious!

### How I like to get my feedback:
To the point

### Technical strengths & weaknesses:
It's difficult to say what my strength are so early into my learning. I like building very modular code as this format makes the most sense to me.

I can be a perfectionist which is a strength in some circumstances and a weakness in others.

I think I struggle to learn and process new coding concepts alongside other people when there's not the space to take time and play around with it. I need to see the outcome of the codes behavior before I can read further into it. 


### Interests (programming or otherwise!):
- Wood carving (mainly making spoons)
- fixing all the holes I make in my clothes
- starting to get into game dev and generative art
- circus
